= Topher's Screeps =

CoffeeScript based controller for MMO RTS screeps.com.


== Running the Code ==

 - Use build.bat to generate a monolithic JavaScript controller file
 - build.bat requires Windows with Cygwin to run, but could be easily modified
   to run on Linux
 - Compiling the JavaScript requires CoffeeScript with coffee-stir
 - build.bat creates a .js file, as well as copying the JavaScript to the
   clipboard. Paste it into the web app.
   - This will be modified when the servers are up and running, but right now
     the only place to play with the screeps is in the online sandbox.


== Current Features ==

Still in the beginning phases of experimenting, nothing is fleshed out.

 - Spawns and controls harvesters, short-range warriors, and healers
 - Memory garbage collector
